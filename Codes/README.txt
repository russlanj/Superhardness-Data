This file named "Codes" includes 2 sets of coding needed for this project:

- The first file called "Code for feature selection" contains the code used for filtering the full 272 features down to 36 using the VT and PC methods mentioned in the paper.

- The second is called "Code for ML" that is basically a code for implementing the optimized XGBoost algorithm for our data.
The algorithm can be easily changed to the algorithms used in the paper by using the default algorithms provided by scikit-learn libraries at : https://scikit-learn.org
